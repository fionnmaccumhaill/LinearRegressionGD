# LinearRegressionGD
Repository for Python code which does a linear regression using gradient descent

This code was mercilessly stolen from the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube. Siraj's video is here:

If you haven't checked out Siraj's YouTube channel yet do yourself a favor and go watch his videos:

I have modified some of the Python code to read a movies' budget CSV file and to make it slightly more flexible when ingesting a CSV file. I have left the gradient descent and linear regression code mostly untouched. Any errors are, of course, mine.
